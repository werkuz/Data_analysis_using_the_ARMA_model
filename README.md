# Data analysis using the ARMA model

The project includes an analysis of real data, specifically the average temperature over the years 1998-2001. The data were collected by a weather station near Heathrow Airport in London, UK, and were sourced from the website [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data).

The project covers topics such as:
1. Data preparation for analysis.
2. Data modeling using the ARMA model.
3. Assessment of model fit.
4. Forecasting for future observations and comparison with actual data.
5. Verification of assumptions regarding noise.
